        <h2 class="title">An introduction to the Sheffield boys</h2>
        <p>
            The Arctic Monkeys are a British rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002.
            Known for their distinctive sound and clever lyrics, they quickly rose to prominence in the mid-2000s.
            Their debut album <i>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i> (<i>WPSIATWIN</i>) was released in 2006.
            It became the fastest-selling debut album in UK chart history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The band, led by vocalist and guitarist <b>Alex Turner</b>, is celebrated for its fusion of indie rock, post-punk, and garage rock influences.
            Other members include <b>Jamie Cook</b> on the guitar, <b>Nick O'Malley</b> as bass player, and drummer <b>Matt Helders</b>.
            The Monkeys have earned critical acclaim and a devoted fan base, making them one of the most influential and enduring acts in modern music.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, they have released seven studio albums, which showcased their evolving musical style.
            Click around below to discover the band's albums discography.

            Let's now subject Arctic Monkey's said evolving musical style to the test of data analysis and visualization!
        </p>
        <p>
            To kick off, here's a visual that shows the median and average song duration in seconds for each album.
            This allows already for an interesting first conclusion, namely that songs have considerably increased in length.
            Not quite sure if the radio stations (or listener's shortening attention span) are happy with that.

        <h2 class="title">The importance of common song sections</h2>
        <p>
            The structure of a song is often divided into different sections, most commonly intro, verse, chorus, bridge, and outro.
            Each section has its own characteristics and importance.
            For example, the <b>chorus</b> is often the most important part of a song, as it contains the main message.
            The <b>verse</b> guides you through the story, and the <b>bridge</b> is a transition between the verse and chorus.
            The <b>intro</b> and <b>outro</b> are the beginning and end of a song.
            Songs can also have standalone <b>instrumental</b> sections.
        </p>

                <h2>An album's perspective first</h2>
                <p>
                    A typical song structure, from intro to outro, is represented from bottom to top.
                    The verse and the chorus take up the biggest proportions of a song.
                    Verses became more important in the last two albums.
                    Instrumental and outro sections have become less prevalent.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <h2><i>Favourite Worst Nightmare</i></h2>
                <p>
                    Take the second album for a songwise perspective.
                    Not all songs have a long-enough intro or outro.
                    The song with the largest outro is <b class="bsongs">If You Were There, Beware</b>.
                    It is an eclectic one for sure!
                    Beautiful closer <b class="bsongs">505</b> has a good equilibrium.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="3">
                <h2><i>Suck It and See</i></h2>
                <p>
                    Moving on to the fourth album, the balance is different.
                    Intro's are limited, and longer verses are becoming more of a thing.
                    The chorus remains key for many songs, such as <b class="bsongs">She's Thunderstorms</b> and <b class="bsongs">Love Is a Laserquest</b>.
                </p>

                <h2><i>AM</i></h2>
                <p>
                    The fifth album is a prime example of balance.
                    Almost all songs follow a dosed pattern of a short intro, to-the-point verses and a Helter Skelter chorus.
                    No wonder this album shot the band to international fame for good.

                <h2><i>The Car</i></h2>
                <p>
                    The latest album continues the trend away from <i>AM</i> and before that.
                    The emphasis strongly shifted to verses.
                    This shows especially throughout the second half of the record, for instance, <b class="bsongs">Perfect Sense</b> has only verses.
                    They must be sending a message.

            It's not easy to discern conclusions from the structure of songs that can change without good reason other than an artist's mood.
            It flows both ways.
            What is striking is the increasing importance of verses, as well as the relevance of the chorus in hit songs.

        <h2 class="title">How lyrically varied are Alex Turner's texts really</h2>
        <p>
            To measure the lyrical variation of a song, a useful metric is the so-called <b>lexical diversity</b>.
            This metric is the ratio of the number of unique words versus the total number of words in a song.
            Lexical diversity ranges between 0% and 100%.
            In other <i>words</i>, the higher this value, the more unique a song can be considered.
        </p>

            <div class="step" data-step="1">
                <h2>Upward trend</h2>
                <p>
                    The dots in the graph show the
                    <span class="label blue">minimum</span>, 
                    <span class="label orange">median</span>, and 
                    <span class="label red">maximum</span> lexical diversity.

                    Looking at all the albums, we notice a trend.
                    The lexical diversity of the albums went up.
                    Remember, the songs became longer (hence, you'd expect more repetitive), but the conclusion holds.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <h2>Debut lexical diversity</h2>
                <p>
                    The first album <i>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i> has a low lexical diversity.
                    About 70% of the words are unique.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="3">
                <h2><i>WPSIATWIN</i></h2>
                <p>
                    The songs are short and punchy.
                    Night-out classic <b class="bsongs">From the Ritz to the Rubble</b> has a surprisingly low value.
                    Does this mean such songs are less creative lyrically?
                    Of course not!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="4">
                <h2>Least unique</h2>
                <p>
                    Self-titled album <i>AM</i> is least lyrically diverse.
                    That should come as no surprise, given the many hits in this album and the heavy focus on choruses.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="5">
                <h2><i>AM</i></h2>
                <p>
                    There's only one song more repetitive than <b class="bsongs">Mad Sounds</b>.
                    You guessed it: the catchy <b class="bsongs">Brick by Brick</b> from the preceding album.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="6">
                <h2>Most unique</h2>
                <p>
                    Arctic Monkey's latest album <i>The Car</i> is lyrically the most diverse.
                    The median lexical diversity is very close to the album maximum, suggesting that at least half of the songs are very unique words-wise.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="7">

                    Again, songs are comparably longer on this album but lyrics are not repetitive at all.
                    Impressive!
                    Only <b class="bsongs">Body Paint</b> is the exception to the rule.
                    It was released as a single...

            How lyrically diverse is the songwriting of Alex Turner then?
            Increasingly so!

        <h2 class="title">The beat of romantic words</h2>
        <p>
            Romance is without a doubt a theme within Arctic Monkeys songs.
            Alex Turner and words, a love story pur sang.
            Yet, do the songs mention love explicitly or is it rather a between-the-lines affair?
            Let's find out how regularly a selection of ten romance-laden words such as <b>love</b>, <b>baby</b>, or <b>heart</b> pop up in the songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Lexical dispersion</b> shows when and how often words occur in a song.
            You can think of it as a timeline of the words in a song.
            The graphs below will take you through that timeline for the selected romantic words.

                    The graph on the right shows the count of the respective word in each album.
                    <b>Love</b>, <b>heart</b> and <b>eyes</b> are the most popular words.
                    Which album conjured up wonderful romantic vibe the most?
                    Let's break it down.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Though by a slight margin, <i>WPSIATWIN</i>, <i>Suck It and See</i> and <i>AM</i> are frequented most by these romantic words.
                    The word <b>baby</b> looks like a first pick, but we will nuance this in what follows.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="3">

                <p>
                    The word <b>romance</b> itself is barely used.
                    Maybe the point's that there ain't no romance in it?
                    Who are we to judge.
                    <b class="bsongs">A Certain Romance</b> might shed more light.

                <h2>Dispersion by song</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a song-by-song timeline of romantic word usage.
                    The popularity of the word <b>baby</b> is mostly due to its clustered use in <b class="bsongs">Snap Out of It</b> and <b class="bsongs">Knee Socks</b>.
                    <i>Suck It and See</i> even has a couple of songs that use none of the words.

                <p>
                    The three most popular words leave a trace to dozens of songs.
                    They are sparely used, only between one and three times per song.

                    We end on a less romantic note, highlighting the two albums superficially not so keen on romance.
                    These albums have a more mysterious touch, which is a nice antidote.

            Of course, a romantic atmosphere is much more subtle than (ten) words can convey.
            We all know that.
            Still, it's amusing to figure out which albums are more straightforward than others in this regard.
