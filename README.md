## What?

A very smooth analysis of Arctic Monkeys song lyrics turned into a scrollytelling web page.

## Where?

Find the web page [here](https://datawanderers.github.io/lyrical-arctic-monkeys).

## How?

The scrollytelling code is expanded from this [example](https://github.com/edriessen/scrollytelling-scrollama-d3-demo). This is another useful beginner's [resource](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/scrollytelling-beginners/tree/master). This is a nice but unrelated piece of [inspiration](https://baryon.be/stories/jamesbond).

**Enjoy!**
