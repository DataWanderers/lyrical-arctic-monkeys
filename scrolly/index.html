        <h2 class="title">The importance of common song sections</h2>
        <p>
            The structure of a song is often divided into different sections, most commonly intro, verse, chorus, bridge, and outro.
            Each section has its own characteristics and importance.
            For example, the <b>chorus</b> is often the most important part of a song, as it contains the main message.
            The <b>verse</b> guides you through the story, and the <b>bridge</b> is a transition between the verse and chorus.
            The <b>intro</b> and <b>outro</b> are the beginning and end of a song.
            Songs can also have standalone <b>instrumental</b> sections.

        <h2 class="title">How lyrically varied are Alex Turner's texts really</h2>
        <p>
            To measure the lyrical variation of a song, a useful metric is the so-called <b>lexical diversity</b>.
            This metric is the ratio of the number of unique words versus the total number of words in a song.
            In other <i>words</i>, the higher this value, the more unique a song can be considered.

                <h2>Upward trend</h2>
                <p>
                    Lexical diversity ranges between 0% and 100%.
                    The dots respectively show the
                    <span class="label blue">minimum</span>, 
                    <span class="label orange">median</span>, and 
                    <span class="label red">maximum</span> lexical diversity.

                    Looking at all the albums, a trend becomes quite clear.
                    The lexical diversity of the albums has increased over the years.

                <h2>Debut lexical diversity</h2>
                <p>
                    The first album "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not" has a low lexical diversity.

                <p>
                    Self-titled album "AM" is least lyrically diverse.
                    That should come as no surprise, given the many hits in this album.

                    There's only one song more repetitive than "Mad Sounds". You guessed it: the catchy "Brick by Brick" from the preceding album.

                <p>
                    Arctic Monkey's latest album "The Car" is lyrically the most diverse.
                    The median lexical diversity is very close to the album maximum, suggesting that at least half of the songs are very unique words-wise.
