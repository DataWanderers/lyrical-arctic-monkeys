        <h2 class="title">An introduction to the Sheffield boys</h2>
        <p>
            The Arctic Monkeys are a British rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002.
            Known for their distinctive sound and clever lyrics, they quickly rose to prominence in the mid-2000s.
            Their debut album "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (WPSIATWIN)" was released in 2006.
            It became the fastest-selling debut album in UK chart history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The band, led by vocalist and guitarist <b>Alex Turner</b>, is celebrated for its fusion of indie rock, post-punk, and garage rock influences.
            Other members include <b>Jamie Cook</b> on the guitar, <b>Nick O'Malley</b> as bass player, and drummer <b>Matt Helders</b>.
            The Monkeys have earned critical acclaim and a devoted fan base, making them one of the most influential and enduring acts in modern music.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, they have released seven studio albums, which showcased their evolving musical style.
            Let's put exactly this to the test of data analysis and visualization!

        <h2 class="title">The importance of common song sections</h2>
        <p>
            The structure of a song is often divided into different sections, most commonly intro, verse, chorus, bridge, and outro.
            Each section has its own characteristics and importance.
            For example, the <b>chorus</b> is often the most important part of a song, as it contains the main message.
            The <b>verse</b> guides you through the story, and the <b>bridge</b> is a transition between the verse and chorus.
            The <b>intro</b> and <b>outro</b> are the beginning and end of a song.
            Songs can also have standalone <b>instrumental</b> sections.

            <div class="step" data-step="1">
                <h2>The Album</h2>
                <p>
                    The story starts with a music album.
                    In this case, it's Avicii's posthumous album TIM. 
                    Each dot represents a song. 
                    Hover over a dot to check the song titles.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <h2>Sentiment</h2>
                <p>
                    Using sentiment analysis,
                    I turn the lyrics of a song into a data point with a sentiment score.
                    The values range from -1.0 to +1.0 and give each song a
                    <span class="label red">negative value</span>, 
                    <span class="label">neutral value</span>, or 
                    <span class="label green">positive value</span>.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <h2>Magnitude</h2>
                <p>
                    Besides a sentiment score, the analysis returns a magnitude value.
                    This tells something about the way the sentiment is expressed in a song.
                    Is it weak or strong?
                    The magnitude defines the size of a dot.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="3">
                <h2>Position x by sentiment</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that each song has two data values,
                    I use those to reposition the songs.
                    First, I change the horizontal position (x-axis) based on the sentiment score.
                    But as you can see, some songs overlap...
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="4">
                <h2>Position y by magnitude</h2>
                <p>
                    In the same way I use the sentiment score for the horizontal position of the songs,
                    I use the magnitude value for the vertical position (y-axis).
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="5">
                <h2>Simplify dots</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that I have updated the positions of the songs,
                    I simplify the visualisation for the next phase of the story.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="6">
                <h2>Draw a path </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up, I draw a path from dot to dot, starting at song 1, moving to song 2, 
                    and continuing like this all the way up to the last song.
                    But the result is a bit edgy...
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="7">
                <h2>Draw a curved path</h2>
                <p>
                    Luckily, there's an alternative.
                    Bezier curves are paths that don't go straight, but curve from data point to data point.
                    And combining this type of path with the data, I get a pretty interesting result...
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step" data-step="8">
                <h2>The result</h2>
                <p>
                    When I clean up the final visualisation, I get a nice view of the generated shape.
                    Keep in mind that this is all generated using code.
                    But it doesn't look like that.
                    It looks like it's a hand-drawn signature. 
                    Pretty cool right?

        <h2 class="title">How lyrically varied are Alex Turner's texts really</h2>
        <p>
            To measure the lyrical variation of a song, a useful metric is the so-called <b>lexical diversity</b>.
            This metric is the ratio of the number of unique words versus the total number of words in a song.
            In other <i>words</i>, the higher this value, the more unique a song can be considered.

                    The trend is quite clear: the lexical diversity of the albums has increased over the years.

        <p>
            <b>Lexical dispersion</b> shows when and how often words occur in a song.
            You can think of it as a timeline of the words in a song.
            The graphs below will take you through that timeline for a couple of common romantic words.
